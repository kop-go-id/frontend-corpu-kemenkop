 * Replaces substrings in a string based on a mapping object.

 * @description
 * This function takes a string and a mapping object, and returns a new string where all occurrences of keys in the mapping object are replaced with their corresponding values.
 * It constructs a regular expression from the keys of the mapping object and uses it to perform case-insensitive replacements in the original string.
